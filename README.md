# firstTTFBCompared

A lightweight collaborative latency-analysis project that measures Time To First Byte (TTFB) with Python and analyzes tail-risk probability in C++ using Simpson's Rule.

## Project Overview
This project started as a collaborative exploration of networking telemetry using math.(I plan to independently benchmark and validate as well as export csv, etc.) It collects TTFB samples from repeated HTTP requests and then models latency behavior with a normal-distribution approximation.

**What is TTFB?**
Time To First Byte (TTFB) is the time from request start until the first response byte arrives. It is a indicator of network and server responsiveness because it captures connection setup, routing, and initial backend latency.

**Why it matters:**
- Helps detect changes in perceived responsiveness.
- Supports data-driven comparisons across runs and environments.

The C++ side computes summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) and estimates tail probability using Simpson's Rule with a dynamic error-bound step calculation. Python is used for data collection.

## Key Features
- Accurate first-byte timing collection via Python `requests` with streaming enabled.
- Timeout/connection-error handling.
- Cross-language workflow: Python collector output used by a C++ analyzer.
- Mean and standard deviation calculation from acquired dataset.
- Tail-area probability estimation with Simpson's Rule and even-step correction.
- CSV Logging using C++ fstream library for further analysis.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- `pip install requests`
- C++17-capable compiler
  - Windows: MSVC (`cl`) or MinGW/GCC (`g++`)
  - Linux/macOS: `g++`

### 1) Install Python Requests Library

```bash
python -m pip install requests
```

### 2) Run collector only (Python)

```bash
python module1.py 20
```

Expected output shape (one TTFB value per line):

```text
108.233519
95.883201
TIMEOUT
101.442307
```

### 3) Build analyzer (C++)

#### Windows (MSVC, Developer Command Prompt)

```powershell
cl /EHsc /std:c++17 "server latency.cpp" latency_monitor.cpp /Fe:ttfb_analyzer.exe
```

#### Windows (MinGW/GCC)

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 "server latency.cpp" latency_monitor.cpp -o ttfb_analyzer.exe
```

#### Linux/macOS (g++)

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 "server latency.cpp" latency_monitor.cpp -o ttfb_analyzer
```

> Note: current code includes Windows-specific calls (`_popen`, `_pclose`, `_getcwd`, `<direct.h>`). For native Linux/macOS builds, switch those calls to `popen`, `pclose`, `getcwd` (or build under Windows/WSL with compatible changes).

### 4) Run full pipeline

#### Default integrated flow (analyzer launches Python collector)

```bash
# Windows
./ttfb_analyzer.exe

# Linux/macOS
./ttfb_analyzer
```


### Timeout and target URL workflow
Current script uses a fixed timeout (`timeout=10`) and URL (`https://www.google.com`) in `module1.py`. Edit those values directly for experiments.

## Architecture and Design

### Simpson's Rule and error control
- Integration target: probability mass from observed maximum latency to a high-tail bound (`mean + 5*stddev`).
- Step selection: `errorBoundFormula(...)` computes `n` from an error tolerance term and ensures `n` is even (required by Simpson's Rule).
- Result: approximate tail probability and derived percentile.

### Where to change parameters
- Sample count input: prompt in `server latency.cpp` and command arg in `module1.py`.
- Request timeout + URL: `module1.py` request config.
- Numerical tolerance behavior: `errorBoundFormula(...)` in `latency_monitor.cpp`.

## Data Format and Telemetry
Current collector emits one measurement per line as a numeric value:

```text
ttfb-ms
```

Example:

```text
102.445901
99.553112
110.229044
```

### Python parsing example (accept both formats)

```python
for raw in lines:
    raw = raw.strip()
    if not raw:
        continue
    parts = raw.split(",")
    ttfb = float(parts[-1])  # works for "ttfb" and "timestamp,ttfb"
```
